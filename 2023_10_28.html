					<section style="font-size:120%;">
						<p> As of today (Oct 28th 2023), this is how the QQQ looks for the last five years.

						</br>
						Alright, no bull shit is needed, just a simple conclusion: QQQ will be doubled in the next five years.
						</br>
						Reason: AI, the de-escalation between China and US.
						</br>
						</br>
						AI: Any explanation is needed? It's 2023, if you doubt AI will not grow super fast, you are an idiot.
						</br>
						The tension between China and US: it's not that easy to catch it, you need multiple sources to feel. But As of October
						2023, I feel very positive.
						</br>
						</br>
						Five years is relatively a "long term" target, so I don't consider other factors like Fed reducing/increasing rate. They will 
						have to reduce it in 2024 anyway.
