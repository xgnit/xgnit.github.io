							<h2>I replaced all my VOO with QLD</h2>

					<section style="font-size:120%;">
						<p> First of all, how about my prediction 4 months ago? Since then QQQ went from 345 straight to 436 as of today (Feb 25th 2024). 
						</br>
						</br>
						
						Also I replaced all my VOO with QLD. I don't need no freaking explanation, just if you 
						cannot see how much AI will change our life, my words will be meaningless for you anyway.

						</br>
						If you are able to see how much it might change our life, you'd be already all in TQQQ.
						</br>
						</br>
						My target for QQQ at the end of 2024 is 480. I don't know if I am being too optimistic or too pessimistic, because that means 20% yearly growth, 
						but we have already finished the first 10%, within 2 months. TWO fucking months.
						</br>
						So only 10% for the rest of 10 months?
						</br>
						The Nasdaq average yearly return in the last 10 years is about 17%, 20% means slightly above average. Are we gonna have some good year, 
						in which we will have significantly higher return? Like 35%?
						</br>
						</br>
						I will not be surprised at all if QQQ hits 520 this year.
